# Automated Email Queries to Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases

This application is a demonstration of using email and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate email
queries to an existing knowledge base.

This is built using the [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) which is a wrapper around
CloudFormation, allowing you to define your cloud resources in your programming language of choice. This particular CDK
app is written in Typescript(NodeJS); it deploys Lambdas written in both Python and TypeScript

This app consists of a single Stack: AutomateEmailsBedrockStack which deploys two custom constructs:

* BedrockKnowledgeBase
    * A complete Bedrock Knowledge Base implementation
* KnowledgeBaseEmailQuery
    * A Step Functions-powered email pipeline utilizing SES, Lambda, and the previously created Bedrock Knowledge Base

**Important**: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the
Free Tier usage - please see
the [AWS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing)
page for details. You are responsible for any AWS costs incurred. No
warranty is implied in this example.

### Architecture

<image src="./architecture_diagram.png" width="1000"/>

To populate the Knowledge base in the architecture workflow, follow these steps (with lettered call-outs on the
right-hand side of the diagram).

The user uploads company and domain specific information (A), like policy manuals to
an [Amazon Simple Storage](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (Amazon
S3) bucket (B) designated as the knowledge base data source.

Amazon S3 invokes an [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function (C) to synchronize the data source with the
knowledge base.

The Lambda function (D) starts data ingestion by calling the StartIngestionJob API function.

The knowledge base (6) splits the documents in the data source into manageable chunks for efficient retrieval. The
knowledge base is set up to
use [Amazon OpenSearch Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/features/serverless/) (7) as its vector
store and an [Amazon Titan](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/titan/) embedding text
model to create the embeddings. During this step, the chunks are converted to embeddings and stored in a vector index in
the OpenSearch vector store for Knowledge Bases of Amazon Bedrock, while also keeping track of the original document.

The architecture workflow for automating email responses using generative AI with the knowledge base includes the
following steps (numbered steps starting on left side of diagram):

A customer (1) sends a natural language email inquiry to an address configured within your domain, such as
[info@example.com](mailto:info@example.com).

[Amazon Simple Email Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/Welcome.html) (2) receives the email and stores
the entire email content to an Amazon S3 bucket with the
unique email identifier as the object key.

An [Amazon EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-what-is.html) (3) rule is triggered
upon receipt of the email in the Amazon S3 bucket and starts an [AWS Step
Function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html) to coordinate the generation and send of
the email response.

A Lambda function (4) retrieves the email content from Amazon S3.

The email identifier and a received timestamp (5) is recorded in
an [Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html) table. You can
utilize the DynamoDB
table to monitor and analyze the email responses that are generated.

By using the body of the email inquiry, the Lambda function (6) creates a prompt query and invokes Amazon Bedrock's
RetrieveAndGenerate API function to generate a response.

Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock use the Amazon Titan embedding model to convert the prompt query to a vector (7), and
then find chunks that are semantically similar. The prompt is then augmented with the chunks that are retrieved from the
knowledge base. We then sent the prompt alongside the additional context to an LLM for response generation. In this
solution, we use [Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.0](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/) as our LLM to generate user
responses using additional context. The Claude
Sonnet 3.0 model is fast, affordable, and versatile, capable of handling various tasks like casual dialogue, text
analysis, summarization, and document question-answering.

A Lambda function (8) constructs an email reply from the generated response and transmits the email reply via Amazon
Simple Email Service to the customer. Email tracking and disposition information is updated in the Amazon DynamoDB
table.

OR

When there's no automated email response, a Lambda function (9) will forward the original email to an internal support
team for them to review and respond to the customer. It updates then email disposition information in the Amazon
DynamoDB table.

# Prerequisites

To set up this solution, complete the following prerequisites:

1. Local machine or VM on which you can install and run AWS CLI tools

2. Local environment prepared to deploy the CDK stack as documented
   in [Getting started with the AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html).

3. Valid domain name with configuration rights over it. NOTE: If you have a domain name registered in Route53 and
   managed in this same account, this CDK will configure Amazon Simple Email Service for you. If your domain is managed
   elsewhere then some manual steps will be necessary (see Deployment Steps below).

4. Amazon Bedrock models enabled for embedding and querying. See documentation on how to enable model access. In the
   default configuration, the following models are required to be enabled:
    - Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2
    - Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet

# Context Values

This app is configurable via a set of values defined in
the [CDK Context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/context.html). Many of these values have defaults but may be
overridden via the --context flag when synth-ing or deploying

| Context Value     | Description                                                                                               | Default                                                                             |

# Deployment Steps

1. Configure an SES domain Identity to allow SES to send and receive messages. If you want to receive email on address
   for a domain managed in Route53, this will be autowired for you if you
   provide the ROUTE53_HOSTED_ZONE context variable. If you manage your domain in a different account or in a registrar
   besides Route53, see section: Manually Verify Domain Identity (Optional)
2. Clone repository and navigate to root
   directory ```git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/automated-emails-for-bedrock-knowledgebases.git && cd automated-emails-for-bedrock-knowledgebases```
3. Install Dependencies `npm install`
4. Deploy App
    ```sh
    cdk deploy --context emailSource={EMAIL_SOURCE} --context emailReviewDest={EMAIL_REVIEW_DEST} --context route53HostedZone {HOSTED_ZONE_NAME}
    ```
    ```sh
    #example 
    cdk deploy --context emailSource=help@mybedrockknowledgebaseapp.com --context emailReviewDest=support@mybedrockknowledgebaseapp.com --context route53HostedZone mybedrockkonwledgebaseapp.com
    ```
5. OPTIONAL - Request SES Production Access. At this point you will
   have [Amazon Simple Email](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) configured with a
   verified domain identity in sandbox mode. You can now send email to any address in that domain. If you need to send
   emails to users with a different domain name you need
   to [request production access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/request-production-access.html)

# Manually Verify Domain Identity (Optional)

If your domain is not managed in Route53 or not managed in the account in which this CDK is being deploy, follow the
steps detailed [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/creating-identities.html#verify-domain-procedure) to
manually verify your domain:

1. Create a Domain Identity in SES (Amazon SES->Identities->Create Identity)
2. Add DKIM records to your DNS provider - locate the generated CName records in the DKIM section and enter
   those into your DNS provider
3. Add DMARC record to your DNS provider - locate the generatedTXT record in the DMARC section and enter into
   your DNS provider
4. Wait for your DNS identity to be verified. You will receive an email that DKIM is setup
5. Add MX record for SES to be able to receive email for your domain (ex. inbound-smtp.{region}.amazonaws.com)

# Upload Source Files to S3

Now that you have a running Bedrock Knowledgebase you need to populate your vector store with the raw data you want to
query. Bedrock Knowledge Bases will automatically sync raw data in an S3 bucket with the Vector database powering
your Knowledge Base. To finish deployment of the app, you need to upload your raw text data to the Knowledge Base source
S3 bucket.

1. Locate the bucket name from the CDK output (KnowledgeBaseSourceBucketArn/Name)
2. Upload your text files, either through the AWS console or the AWS CLI.

If you are testing this solution out, we recommend using the documents in
this [open source HR manual](https://github.com/opengovfoundation/hr-manual?tab=readme-ov-file). Upload the files in
either the markdown or PDF folders. Your Knowledge Base will then automatically sync those files to the vector database.

# Finish Configuring SES

The mechanism for send and receiving emails is [Amazon Simple Email Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/). As part of
the deployment steps you will end up with an SES Identity for a specific domain name, meaning you can freely send and
receive emails on that domain.

If you need to be able to send emails to addresses of other domains you need to move your SES account out of sandbox
mode by [requesting production access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/request-production-access.html)

# Test

Send an email to the address defined in the "sourceEmail" context param. If you opted to upload the sample HR documents
referenced above here are some examples:

> How many days of PTO do I get?

> To whom do I report an HR violation?
